        <h3>Master’s Thesis – Generative Model for Video Montage Creation</h3>
        <p>This research proposes a generative approach for video montage creation by aligning textual input with video representations. Using Unmasked Teacher (UMT) for encoding and GPT-based autoregression, the model predicts semantically meaningful video embeddings. It achieved state-of-the-art performance on the VSPD dataset in terms of IoU, UMS, and SMS scores.</p>

        <h3>Training Noisy Real vs Generated Images for Attribute Classification</h3>
        <p>This project involves finding and downloading images based on specific attributes. We compared the performance of the OpenCLIP model trained on real noisy images and synthetic images generated using Stable Diffusion. The study highlights how noisy real data leads to better generalization compared to synthetic data.</p>

        <h3>6sense – Multimodal Conversational AI for the Visually Impaired</h3>
        <p>Built during the <strong>Tech: Europe Karlsruhe AI Hackathon</strong> (Runner-up), 6sense is a real-time voice-based AI assistant that combines computer vision and LLMs to assist visually impaired users. It enables navigation and document understanding through speech. It integrates Mistral AI for reasoning, ElevenLabs for speech synthesis, and depth estimation, OCR, and object recognition models hosted on Runpod.</p>
